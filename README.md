This project aims to predict the popularity of online news articles using the UCI Online News Popularity dataset. The core of the investigation is a comparative analysis of the machine learning algorithms: Random Forest, XGBoost, and Multi-Layer Perceptron. The secondary focus is placed on evaluating the impact of advanced feature selection techniques: Fisher Score and Genetic Algorithm implemented with the DEAP framework.
